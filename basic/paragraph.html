            <mark>MONEY IS EVERYTHING</mark>
        </p>
    <p>
        You’ll realize that money itself is just a neutral, unlimited resource that’s available to anyone who is willing to control it. It doesn’t exist to make your life miserable and it certainly can’t buy your happiness (or can it? more on that later).
    </p>
    <P>
        This might be a silly question to think about (as you stare at your credit card bill), but it’s helpful to challenge your assumptions about money.

For most of us, money is absolutely a necessity. We need it for shelter, food, and clothing. Without these basics, your life would be in serious trouble. Money is the resource that allows you to attain a certain level of security and safety. To a certain degree, money helps you survive.
